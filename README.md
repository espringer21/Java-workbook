# Java workbook


I have acquired proficiency in developing multi-user applications utilizing an enterprise application framework. This respiratory encompasses various aspects including Context and Dependency Injection, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Functional Testing, and LDAP/Database Authentication. Additionally, I worked on the ability to write code to manage and query data from diverse sources such as text files, relational databases, REST APIs, and geospatial data. Furthermore, writing and testing code for utilizing web services and crafting custom web services, leveraging skills in JSON Processing, REST Client, REST API, and Microservices. Moreover, I have developed skills in implementing best practices for securing server-side web applications and RESTful services, covering areas like Session-based Authentication, Token-based Authentication, Role-based Access Control (RBAC) Authorization, and Encryption and Decryption. Additionally, I implemented scheduling tasks for sending notifications, bulk processing data, and generating reports, employing techniques like Batch Processing, Timer Service, and Sending email notifications. Lastly, I am worked on building server-side web applications that access a database backend or REST API, encompassing skills in server-side web applications accessing relational databases, utilizing REST APIs for data management, and implementing Session-Based and Token-Based Authentication.
